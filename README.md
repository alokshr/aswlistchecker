# ASW List Bulk File Checker

This is a small HTML file used to do a rough scan of the .csv/.txt files used for ASW list bulk user adds/removes.

This is not meant for use outside of the Solution Center and is only an estimate of what ASW accepts while parsing .csv/.txt files, so please do not take this checker as the truth.
